[Tabs Outliner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl)
--------------------------------------------

Next Generation Session/Windows/Tabs Manager and Too_Many_Open_Tabs Solution That Really Works.

*  Ultimate overview for all of your open, and not so open (read further), browser windows and tabs, in a resizable vertical side view, with a Tree Style Tab feature.
*  A KILLER FEATURE – Has the unique ability to close and preserve “in place” any tab or window, without removing them from the original context in the tree. Then, if needed, reopen them in the same way you select already open windows or tabs.
    This is a real innovation in Web browser usability. It diminishes the cognitive distinction between closed-preserved and open tabs. Therefore, there will be no substantial difference between closed or open tabs, and because of this, there will be no desire to keep them all open anymore!!!
*  Outliner Features – You will be able annotate open or closed windows and tabs, add comments to them, notes, a summary of main ideas, to-do items. Organize all of this in logical hierarchies and delimited groups; freely reorder to specify priority or importance.
*  Crash Resistance and Restore Feature Done Right.

[Frame two pages](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frame-two-pages/eldgpcphflnopbjadiaonofideekgdgm)
--------------------------------------------

Merge the active tab and the previous one into a frameset.

Once you click at the extension's icon, the current tab will be merged with the previous one (on the left) into a frameset with two columns (frames) or rows (options offer 3 buttons: rows/columns/ad_hoc). They'll be ordered in the same way as the tabs (left, right).

In other words, your physical screen will be split into two areas.

If the current window only has one tab, you'll be asked about the URL of the left frame. Recursive frames work - e.g. if you activate the extension on a new tab - but each smaller frame's URL has to be typed manually ("same origin policy").

This gadget may be helpful if you are e.g. translating one page to another page or otherwise editing a text, using two windows.

[Split Screen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/split-screen/eachfleknamlcepmplpdghagngjfjkin)
--------------------------------------------

Prompts the user for two URL addresses and then displays both in one window!

Opens a new tab and prompts the user for two URL's, then displays both sites on one page. Great for cross-reference studying and surfing the web in general! Watch a video, (or wait for it to buffer) while you surf another webpage.

[Dual View Split Screen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dual-view-split-screen/gmdbkgponhaodlapckmpicgahloncdog)
--------------------------------------------

Splits the screen into two vertical tiles.
Dual View Split Screen lets you split your screen into two vertical tiles. You are able to view two different pages side by side which comes in handy when you want to compare content, translate content and so on.

Click on the screen icon in your browser bar. You will be asked to provide the URL of the left window. Then you will be asked for the right window accordingly.

Nothing else to take care of. It is as easy as that. Enjoy!

[Chromie: Window and Tab Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromie-window-and-tab-to/mcgjgfcidldkpkanmdmedhpidpiegabg)
-------------------------------------------

Manipulates (splits, merges, scrolls, indexes) Chrome's windows with simple clicks.

* Split/Merge Chrome Windows to occupy the whole screen with different workspaces.
   * Double-click Chromie icon to create 2 workspaces.
   * Triple-click Chromie icon to create 3 workspaces.
   * Quadruple-click to create 4 workspaces.
   * and so on to unlimited workspaces theoretically (but it seems that 4 windows or less are the most efficient).
   * Yeah and of course, single-click will merge all windows into 1 big Chromie.
   * Another single-click will toggle between the big Chromie and the original Chromie where we started off with.
* Synchronize Windows scrolling actions (syncScroll) among different windows by holding Alt + mouse wheel(or Shift + mouse wheel will be implemented soon enough).
* There are options of layouts for you to pick and you decide how fast you can click by choosing click timeout parameter (where 200 millisecs is recommended).

[Tab Resize - split screen layouts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-resize-split-screen-l/bkpenclhmiealbebdopglffmfdiilejc)
--------------------------------------------

[DEMO video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD3hrdxn3QU)

### How it works ###
* The selected/highlighted tab along with all tabs to the right of it will be considered. Whether you have more or less tabs than are needed the extension will resize only the available tabs.
* Undo button will undo the previous layout resize. You can only perform undo once at any time.
* In 'single tab' mode, only the selected/highlighted tab will considered. Only the current window/tab will change in size, all other tabs to the right will be ignored.
* You can create your own custom layouts within reason and reset to default configurations if desired. Layouts are sorted most recent used on right.

[Tab Scissors](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-scissors/cdochbecpfdpjobpgnacnbepkgcfhoek)

This simple tab organization tool divides one window into two.
If you have at least two tabs in the selected Chrome window, it will split that window into two smaller side-by-side windows. All the tabs on the left side of the selected tab will stay in the left window, and the rest will move to the window on the right.
It is especially helpful for those who have lots of tabs opened at a time.
This extension works great with [Tab Glue](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-glue/mfedioikeigljhjfpghdejnogniddhna), which will glue all those pesky Chrome windows back together.

[Split Meister V](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/split-meister-v/jmoblnpbicfhjfldifijonmpalgidhmd)
-------------------------------------------
